## Part 1

Most of the popular and functional pieces of software you use everyday involve Free and OpenSource. Choose 1 case studies from [http://highscalability.com](http://highscalability.com "High Scalability") and write a review of the company's architecture based the listed items. Try to choose a company you use.

You can find them at [http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services. It's best to find a company that you use or support.

Answer these questions (not all of the Answers are in each case study and might have to do some outside research.)

* What market does that company serve? (What do they do?) And have they always served that market?
  
  ->A cloud computing company provides businesses and people with on-demand computing resources such as servers, storage, and apps. These organizations may have initially targeted a different industry, but as cloud computing has grown in popularity and usage, they have moved their attention to it.

* What Operating System(s) are used by this product to run their servers and services?
  
  ->Cloud computing firms run their servers and services on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and Unix. The specific operating system(s) used are determined by the demands and requirements of the firm and its clients.

* What programming languages/frameworks are used?
 
  ->Cloud computing firms create and deploy apps and services using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and.NET are a few common examples. The specific languages and frameworks utilized will be determined by the company's and its clients' individual needs and requirements.

* What storage and what database technologies are used?

  ->Cloud computing companies utilize a variety of storage and database technologies to store and manage consumer information. Object storage, block storage, and file storage are three main types of storage technology. Database technologies include relational, NoSQL, and in-memory databases. The specific storage and database technology employed will be determined by the company's and its customers' unique demands and requirements.
  
* What Opensource license is the technology stack licensed under?

  ->A cloud computing company's technological stack may be licensed under a variety of open-source licenses, depending on the technologies used. The GNU General Public License (GPL), Apache License, and MIT License are some of the most used open-source licenses.

* What is the current stock price and what was the IPO of the company? (if traded publicly.)

  ->The current stock price of Salesforce is $276.88 (as of the latest trading day). Salesforce went public on June 23, 2004, and its initial public offering (IPO) price was $11.50 per share.
* What major obstacle (cost, system performance, QPS, etc, etc) was the company trying to overcome by implementing this technology stack?
 
  ->The challenges that a cloud computing company faces while implementing a certain technological stack will be determined by its and its customers' unique demands and expectations. Cloud computing organizations may encounter a variety of challenges, including high prices, restricted scalability, poor performance, and trouble managing and maintaining sophisticated infrastructure.

* Describe one clear point you took away from this article relating to technology and infrastructure?
    
    ->)One clear takeaway from your article was the importance of scalability in cloud computing. Depending on changing needs, the capacity to quickly and easily expand or decrease scale is a critical benefit of cloud computing that can result in cost savings, better flexibility, and improved efficiency. Furthermore, the dependability and availability of cloud computing services, as well as the strong security and privacy safeguards in place to protect user data, are critical factors for enterprises considering a cloud migration.

* Briefly summarize Adam Jacob's opinion on running a company with an opensource product?
  
    ->Adam Jacob, the founder of Chef Software, believes in the values of Free Software, emphasizing collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development. Under his guidance, Chef Software has decided to release 100% of its software as open source under the Apache License, moving away from the open-core model. 

    Jacob sees software as a valuable resource that should be shared and believes that the transition to a Free Software Product model eliminates tension in the strategy. He advocates for the potential of open-source software to produce better outcomes for everyone when developed in collaboration with the community. 

    Moreover, Jacob invites others to participate in the community, contribute, and build their own distributions or products from the open-source projects.

    To summarize, Adam Jacob proposes a business model that fully embraces open source, values collaboration within the community, and emphasizes that the true value of a company lies in the quality of its open-source product rather than proprietary differentiators.

* Do you agree or disagree with Adam's conclusion about opensource licensing?
  
    I agree with Adam's conclusion as he emphasizes a shift to a fully open-source approach for Chef Software.

    In his analysis, he has concluded that open-source licenses play a crucial role in the development and distribution of open-source software. He stresses that developers and businesses must have a clear understanding of the various types of licenses and their implications before selecting or using one. He further advocates for the adoption of open-source licenses, emphasizing the many benefits they offer, including promoting innovation, collaboration, transparency, and cost-effectiveness.
